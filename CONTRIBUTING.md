## Repository layout

DallyControl is a monorepo with four planes (full map in **[STRUCTURE.md](STRUCTURE.md)**):

| Path | Plane | Stack |
|------|-------|-------|
| `common/`, `server/`, `jwt/`, `notification/`, `plugins/` | Control plane (server / REST API) | Java · Jersey · Guice · MyBatis · PostgreSQL |
| `web/` | Admin console | React · TypeScript · Vite |
| `agent-android/` | Device agent | Kotlin · coroutines · WorkManager (Gradle) |
| `supervisor/` | Updater / recovery service | Node (zero deps) |
| `proto/`, `docs/adr/` | Protocol source of truth + decision records | — |

Architecture decisions live in [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr); read the relevant ADR before changing a
load-bearing area (signing, device IDs, the agent contract, etc.).

---

## Dev setup & commands

You only need the toolchain for the plane you're touching.

### Console (`web/`)
```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev          # Vite dev server on :5173, proxied to the dev stack (VITE_DEV_PROXY_TARGET to change)
npm run build        # production build
npx tsc -b --noEmit  # type-check (-b: tsconfig.json only references the real projects)
```

### Server (`common/`, `server/`)
Requires **JDK 17** and Maven.
```bash
cp -n server/build.properties.example server/build.properties   # once: the server build reads it
mvn -pl common test          # fast, DB-free unit + contract tests
mvn -pl server -am compile   # type-check the server + its modules
mvn -pl server -am package -DskipTests   # build the WAR (full build)
```
The full server run needs PostgreSQL: use the dev stack below.

### Agent (`agent-android/`)
Requires **JDK 17** + the **Android SDK** (set `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`). A `local.properties` with `sdk.dir`
also works.
```bash
cd agent-android
./gradlew :proto:test :core:test          # unit tests
./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin          # type-check the app + its modules
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug               # build a debug APK
./gradlew detekt                           # static analysis (baseline: config/detekt/baseline.xml)
```
Install on an emulator and promote to Device Owner for testing:
`adb install app-debug.apk && adb shell dpm set-device-owner com.dallycontrol.agent.debug/com.dallycontrol.agent.admin.AdminReceiver`

### Updater/recovery (`supervisor/`)
```bash
cd supervisor
node --test          # pure-logic unit tests (no deps)
cd .. && docker build -f docker/supervisor.Dockerfile -t dallycontrol-supervisor:dev . \
  && scripts/supervisor-smoke.sh dallycontrol-supervisor:dev   # boots the image the way compose runs it
```

### The whole stack, locally
```bash
docker compose --env-file docker/dev.env up -d --build   # Postgres + server + Caddy/console + supervisor, loopback only
scripts/dev-seed.sh                                       # first run: seed the DB; console http://localhost:8088, admin / admin
scripts/agent-v1-e2e.sh http://localhost:8080             # the Agent v1 end-to-end suite against it
```
Ports, the fast Java loop, the debugger and reset are in **[docs/DEV.md](docs/DEV.md)**. `./setup.sh` is the
production installer (it writes a `.env` for a real host); see **[DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md)**.

## Workflow

1. **Branch** off `main` (`feat/…`, `fix/…`, `docs/…`). Don't commit to `main` directly.
2. **Make focused changes** — one logical change per PR. Match the style of the code around you.
3. **Test what you touched** with the commands above; add or update tests for behavior changes.
4. **Update docs** when you change behavior, config, or the API.
5. **Open a PR** against `main` using the [PR template](.github/pull_request_template.md).

### CI
Every PR and every push to `main` runs two tiers; each skips the parts your change can't affect.
- **T0** (`.github/workflows/t0-fast.yml`): builds each plane you touched and runs its DB-free tests, plus the
  supervisor image smoke test and the edge (Caddy + compose) check. The agent step also runs detekt: new Kotlin
  must be clean; pre-existing findings are listed in `agent-android/config/detekt/baseline.xml`.
- **T1** (`.github/workflows/t1-e2e.yml`): the Agent v1 end-to-end suite against a real server and Postgres. It
  runs the loop from [docs/DEV.md](docs/DEV.md) (the dev stack, `scripts/dev-seed.sh`, `scripts/agent-v1-e2e.sh`)
  on its own compose project, image tag and ephemeral ports. It runs when a change touches the server, `proto/`,
  `install/`, the server image, the dev stack or the suite. A red T1 on `main` opens a tracking issue.

### Commit messages
Short, imperative, prefixed: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`. Explain the
*why* in the body when it isn't obvious.

### The one hard rule: the agent ↔ server contract is additive-only
The `/agent/v1` REST contract must stay backward-compatible so older agents keep working across server
updates: **new request fields are optional + defaulted; never remove, rename, or repurpose a field, and
never add a required request field.** A genuine break means a new `/agent/v2` (v1 stays). This is
enforced by a golden contract test in CI — see [ADR-0009](docs/adr/0009-agent-v1-contract-stability.md).

## Dependency updates

Every Monday Dependabot opens grouped PRs from [`.github/dependabot.yml`](.github/dependabot.yml): one each for
server Maven, web npm, GitHub Actions, Dockerfile base images and compose images, and two for the agent's Gradle
deps (`agent-toolchain`, `agent-libs`).

- **T0 green is necessary, not sufficient.** T0 compiles and runs the DB-free tests only. Before merging a group
  that moves a runtime library across a minor/major, run that plane's runtime check too: web —
  `cd web && npm run build && cd ../scripts/shots && npm install && npx playwright install chromium && node capture.mjs --check`
  (`playwright install` fetches the browser the check drives; a no-op once it is there); server — the `t1-e2e`
  workflow (`agent-e2e` job) must be green on the PR (it builds the server image and runs the suite); agent —
  install the APK on a device/emulator and complete a check-in.
- **Known-bad lines are ignored, with a reason.** Each `ignore` in `dependabot.yml` names the migration that lifts
  it (javax → jakarta / Tomcat 10+, jjwt API port, Postgres major, …). Remove the ignore in that migration's PR —
  never merge a Dependabot PR that crosses one piecemeal. AGP 9 is not ignored: it and everything coupled to it
  (Gradle 9, Kotlin, KSP, Hilt, detekt, …) arrive together in the `agent-toolchain` group, which is expected to
  stay red until the AGP 9 migration and is never merged piecemeal.
- **Licenses:** a bump that changes a dependency's license (e.g. Liquibase 5 → FSL) is blocked until reviewed
  against [ADR-0008](docs/adr/0008-licensing-and-rebrand.md).
- **One JDK, one Node line.** The server builds and runs on **JDK 17** (CI, Docker build + `tomcat:9.0-jdk17`
  runtime, native installer). Node is the current **LTS** line — today **24**. The supervisor image
  (`docker/supervisor.Dockerfile`) is on it; the web build image (`docker/web.Dockerfile`, 22) and `@types/node`
  (20) are not yet, and `web/package.json` has no `engines` pin yet, so CI builds the web with the runner's
  default Node. They move to 24 in one PR that also adds `engines`. After that, all of them move together once
  the next even line has been LTS for a few months. Docker base images use floating tags, so rebuilds pick up
  patches; a tag change is a deliberate PR. The exception is the edge's `caddy` image (`docker/web.Dockerfile`),
  pinned to an exact release so how the Caddyfile parses changes only through a Dependabot PR that T0's `edge`
  check has validated.
- **Vendored CI actions** (`.github/actions/ci-kit/`) change only by re-running ci-kit's `scripts/vendor.sh`.

## What makes a PR easy to merge

- It's small and does one thing.
- Tests pass for the affected plane; new behavior has a test.
- UI changes include a screenshot or short clip.
- Docs are updated alongside the code.
- It respects the agent contract rule above and any relevant ADR.

Not sure where to start? Look for issues labelled **good first issue**, or open a discussion before a
large change so we can agree on the approach.

### What to expect after you open something
- Issues and PRs get a first maintainer reply within a week. If it has been longer, a polite ping is welcome.
- CI does not run automatically on a **first-time contributor's** PR (GitHub's default); a maintainer approves
  it after a quick read. Nothing you need to do.
- `main` is protected against force-pushes and deletion. Maintainers do land small fixes on `main` directly;
  everything else goes through a PR.
- Security issues: see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) — please don't file them publicly.

## Regenerating the docs screenshots

The console screenshots in the README are produced from the real SPA against sample data:
```bash
cd web && npm run build          # build the SPA first
cd ../scripts/shots && npm install && node capture.mjs
```
Output lands in `docs/screenshots/`. See `scripts/shots/` for the harness + fixtures.
