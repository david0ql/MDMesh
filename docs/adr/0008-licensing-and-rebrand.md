# ADR 0008 — Licensing & rebrand (building on Apache-2.0 Headwind)

**Status:** Accepted (2026-06-21)

## Context

The product forks Headwind MDM. We need to (a) confirm we can legally build a
proprietary product on it, and (b) avoid "legality hiccups" — chiefly trademark misuse.
Directive from the owner: use *just enough* of the upstream backend to get going, then
progressively replace it with our own code so we own the project.

## Findings

- **Both upstream repos are Apache-2.0** (`hmdm-server`, `hmdm-android`). Permissive, no
  copyleft: we may modify, redistribute, sublicense, and keep our additions closed/proprietary.
- No copyleft (GPL/AGPL/LGPL) dependency contamination found by name across the server's
  ~70 artifacts. (A formal `mvn license` scan is a pre-launch follow-up.)
- Headwind's "Enterprise/Pro" features (e.g. real COSU kiosk) are closed-source and are NOT in
  the Apache-2.0 community repo we forked — we build those ourselves; no license entanglement.

## Decision

Build a proprietary product on the Apache-2.0 base via a **strangler** approach: retain the
community backend as a foundation and replace modules with our own (closeable) code over time.
New components (Kotlin agent, `proto/`, React `web/`, agent v1 endpoints) are original works.

**Obligations we will honor:**
1. Keep upstream Apache license headers on retained/derived files; new files carry our header.
2. Propagate `NOTICE` (Apache §4d) — upstream attribution retained, ours added (done in `NOTICE`).
3. Modifications are tracked via git history (§4b).
4. **No trademark use** (§6): the product is NOT named "Headwind"; no Headwind logos/marks; no
   implied endorsement. All product-facing surfaces get rebranded (starts with the React UI).
5. Run a formal dependency license scan + obtain legal sign-off before commercial launch.

## Consequences

- (+) Free to commercialize and keep our work closed; no obligation to upstream.
- (+) Strangler path de-risks: never blocked, migrate at our pace.
- (−) Must pick and apply a product brand (the `com.hmdm` package namespace is cosmetic legacy,
  not a legal issue; renaming it is optional cleanup). The new agent already uses `com.dallycontrol`.
- This is practical guidance, not legal advice; §5 sign-off remains required.
