# ◧ DallyControl

**A modern, self-hosted Android MDM** — fleet control, kiosk, app delivery, and
signed auto-updates, with a console that doesn't feel like 2012.

## What is DallyControl?

DallyControl is an open-source **Mobile Device Management** platform for Android: enroll devices as
Device Owner via a QR code, then manage them from a clean web console — push apps, lock devices into
kiosk mode, track location, run remote actions, and keep the whole fleet (server **and** agent) updated
with **signed, auto-rolling-back** releases.

It began as a fork of [Headwind MDM](https://h-mdm.com) and is being rebuilt into a distinct product
across four planes:

| Plane | What it is | Stack |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Control plane** | The MDM server / REST API | Java · Jersey · Guice · MyBatis · PostgreSQL |
| **Admin console** | The modern web UI in this README | React · TypeScript · Vite |
| **Device agent** | A from-scratch Device-Owner app | Kotlin · coroutines · WorkManager |
| **Edge + updates** | TLS edge, tunnel, signed updater/recovery | Caddy · Cloudflare Tunnel · minisign |

### Our goal

> A **genuinely complete, robust, and modernized** open-source MDM — not a museum piece with a paywalled
> "enterprise edition." Kiosk, app delivery, location, reliable connectivity, one-command deployment, and
> a real CI/CD auto-update pipeline are all in the **open-source core**. The agent is engineered against a
> versioned, capability-negotiated protocol so the Android version treadmill stays cheap to maintain, and
> old agents keep working across server updates.

<summary><b>Full feature list</b></summary>

- **Enrollment** — QR-code Device-Owner provisioning (factory-reset → scan); one signed APK serves every
  deployment (server URL delivered in the QR, not baked in). USB/ADB enrollment (`scripts/adb-enroll.sh`) for
  devices where Play Protect blocks QR provisioning of a self-signed DPC.
- **Remote view/control** — see and drive the device's screen from the browser through droidVNC-NG, a Mode-II
  repeater and the noVNC viewer, from the device page's **Remote** tab. The session travels encrypted inside the
  server's HTTPS (Android 7+, [ADR 0010](docs/adr/0010-remote-control-droidvnc.md)).
- **App management** — remote silent uninstall from the device page's Apps tab, and configuration apps marked
  "remove" are uninstalled automatically.
- **Android 6 to 17** — the agent runs from Android 6 (API 23); tested release by release (see
  [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md)).
- **Modern console** — dashboard, fleet views, device detail, app catalog, enrollment, settings; dark/light
  themes; keyboard-friendly and responsive.
- **Remote actions** — lock-screen message, alert, ring, lock, reboot, passcode reset, factory wipe,
  connectivity power mode, location mode — all capability-gated so old agents never get a command they
  can't run.
- **Kiosk** — COSU lock-task, home-screen replacement, allowed-apps, themed app grid, crash-loop protection.
- **App management** — upload/parse APKs, F-Droid catalog, silent Device-Owner install/upgrade, version &
  downgrade gating.
- **Telemetry** — battery, storage, network, Android version, Device-Owner status, lifecycle event timeline.
- **Deployment** — one `./setup.sh`: Docker Compose with bundled auto-HTTPS (Caddy) for your own domain, or
  a permanent Cloudflare Tunnel; a native (non-Docker) installer; generated secrets.
- **CI/CD auto-update** — tag a release → CI builds & **signs** artifacts (Ed25519/minisign) + a manifest →
  every deployment notices, **verifies**, and (on approval, or unattended) updates server/web with a
  database backup and **automatic rollback** on failure; a decoupled recovery service stays up if an
  update breaks the main server.
- **Staged device rollout** — push the newest **compatible** agent APK to a hand-picked **canary** set,
  watch it land, then **promote to the fleet** — mirrored from your own origin, integrity-checked.
- **Backward compatibility** — versioned `/agent/v1` contract (additive-only, golden contract test in CI),
  so a newer server keeps serving older agents.
- **Desired-state configuration** — saving a configuration makes its devices converge to it: the server
  hashes the configuration into a revision and pushes one `config.apply` command whenever a device's
  applied revision differs, at the next check-in. The device detail page shows sync state and per-field
  outcomes; the configuration list shows how many of its devices are in sync. Only capability-advertising
  agents receive it — older agents show "agent too old" instead of silently ignoring it. Enforced fields
  (18): main app, kiosk mode + exit/home/recents/notifications/system-info/keyguard/lock-buttons, kiosk exit
  password, background/text color, icon size, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB storage, block screenshots, and location
  reporting mode. Name and description are configuration metadata and are not sent to devices.

## 🚀 Quick start

**Requirements:** Docker + Docker Compose v2 + `openssl`/`curl`. A Linux host.

### Option A — one line, no clone (published images)

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/david0ql/MDMesh/main/quickstart.sh)
```

Pulls the released images from GHCR (no build), generates secrets, brings the stack up in `./dallycontrol`,
and prints the console URL + a temporary admin password. *(Needs a published release with **public**
GHCR packages — or `docker login ghcr.io` first; see [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).)* Image tags carry **no `v`
prefix**: release `v0.2.6` publishes `ghcr.io/david0ql/dallycontrol-server:0.2.6` (and `:latest`).

### Option B — from source (clone + build)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/david0ql/MDMesh.git
cd MDMesh
./setup.sh           # interactive: Cloudflare Tunnel, or your own HTTPS domain
```

Either way, `setup.sh`/`quickstart.sh` is interactive (Cloudflare Tunnel or your own HTTPS domain),
generates your secrets, and prints the console URL + a generated admin password. Then:

1. Open the console — you'll be prompted to **set your own password** on first login.
2. Go to **Enroll** and generate a QR code.
3. **Factory-reset** an Android device and tap the welcome screen 6× to open the QR scanner (or use
   `adb shell dpm set-device-owner` for a dev device).
4. Scan the QR — the device enrolls as Device Owner and checks in.

No Docker? Run `./setup.sh --native`. Full details, hosting modes, updates, recovery, and uninstalling are in the
**[full setup guide → DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md)**.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome — code, docs, bug reports, and ideas. Start with **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)**
for the dev setup (server, agent, console), build/test commands, and conventions.

- **🐞 Found a bug?** Open a [bug report](https://github.com/david0ql/MDMesh/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml).
- **💡 Have an idea?** Open a [feature request](https://github.com/david0ql/MDMesh/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml).
- **🔧 Sending a PR?** The [PR template](.github/pull_request_template.md) has the checklist — small, focused PRs with tests + docs are easiest to merge.

> One hard rule for the agent ↔ server contract: the `/agent/v1` API is **additive-only** so older agents
> keep working. See [ADR-0009](docs/adr/0009-agent-v1-contract-stability.md).
