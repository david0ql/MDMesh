# Edge check: does the edge config the stack ships actually load, and do its health routes tell the truth?
#   1. `caddy validate` docker/Caddyfile in every hosting mode, using the SAME caddy image the web image is built
#      FROM (read from docker/web.Dockerfile, so CI and production cannot disagree). validate, not adapt: adapt
#      accepts values (e.g. a bad TRUSTED_PROXIES) that only fail when the config is provisioned.
#   2. `docker compose config -q` for every compose file / overlay / profile combination the installers use.
#   3. /healthz and /healthz/supervisor (with or without a trailing slash), served by that caddy against stub upstreams:
#      503 + reason while the upstream is down or failing (not the SPA's or the recovery page's catch-all 200), 200 "ok"
#      once it answers.
#   4. The dev stack (docker-compose.dev.yml over docker-compose.yml) with docker/dev.env alone, and that the overlay
#      refuses to load without it.
# Guards the v0.3.1 Cloudflare-mode break: `email {$ACME_EMAIL}` with the empty ACME_EMAIL that setup.sh and
# quickstart.sh write made the edge refuse to start, and nothing in CI parsed the Caddyfile.
# Needs only a Docker daemon (+ compose plugin). Throwaway --rm containers, no network, no ports.
