#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Shared database provisioning steps for the three installers (setup.sh, quickstart.sh,
# install/install-native.sh). Source this file; do not execute it.
#
# The caller defines PSQL as an ARRAY that runs psql against the DallyControl database, e.g.
#   PSQL=(docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U dallycontrol -d dallycontrol)
#   PSQL=(dallycontrol_psql)   # a function that passes the password off the command line (install-native.sh)
# Every function here is strict (ON_ERROR_STOP) and verifies its own postcondition, so a
# failure is a non-zero return with the psql output on stderr — never a warning.
#
# History: each installer used to carry its own copy of this logic and they drifted. setup.sh
# decided "fresh install" by counting users AFTER first boot, but Liquibase itself inserts the
# admin user, so fresh installs were never seeded (default admin password, no enrollment
# defaults). quickstart.sh never ran the post-seed repairs, so enrollment was off. Keep the
# rules in one place.
#
# Compatibility rule: quickstart.sh is fetched from main but downloads THIS file from the latest
# release tag (from main only when the release can't be resolved). Never rename a function that
# quickstart.sh calls or change its arguments or output; a new function may be called from
# quickstart.sh only after a release that ships it.
