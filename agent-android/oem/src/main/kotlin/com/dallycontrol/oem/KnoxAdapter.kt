 * PARKED. Samsung Knox adapter stub.

 * Intentionally carries **no** Knox SDK dependency: pulling in the proprietary
 * Knox jar bloats the base APK and trips Play Protect heuristics, so it stays out
 * of the default fleet until there is a concrete Knox requirement. When revived,
 * this moves behind a `knox` build flavor and reflectively probes for the Knox
 * runtime; [isAvailable] returns false here so it is never selected.
