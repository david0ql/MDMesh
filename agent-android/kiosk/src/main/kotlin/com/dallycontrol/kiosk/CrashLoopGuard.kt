/**
 * Safety valve for kiosk deployments: a misconfigured allowlist or a crashing kiosk
 * app can pin a Device-Owner device in an unrecoverable boot/crash loop. This guard
 * counts crashes inside a rolling time window; once the threshold is exceeded the
 * caller stops self-restarting and surfaces a recovery path (e.g. exit lock-task /
 * offer a launcher chooser) so a broken DPC cannot brick the device.
 *
 * Ported from Headwind MDM's `CrashLoopProtection` (Apache-2.0). The counting logic
 * is deliberately Android-free so it is unit-testable on the JVM:
 * - the clock is injected via [now];
 * - the persisted counter lives behind [FaultStore], with a SharedPreferences-backed
 *   impl ([SharedPrefsFaultStore]) for production and [InMemoryFaultStore] for tests.
 *
 * @property store persisted fault counter + last-fault timestamp.
 * @property now wall-clock time source in millis; injectable for tests.
