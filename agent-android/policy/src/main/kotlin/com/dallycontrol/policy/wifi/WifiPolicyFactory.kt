/**
 * Selects the correct [WifiPolicy] strategy for the current device — the single
 * place the `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT` branch is resolved.
 *
 * Candidates are ordered most-capable-first; the first [WifiPolicy.isSupported]
 * wins. Returns `null` when the device supports no strategy at all (e.g. not a
 * Device Owner), in which case the `wifi` capability is simply never advertised.
