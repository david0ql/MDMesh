 * A policy that is a simple on/off toggle (Wi-Fi, camera, Bluetooth, screenshots, ...).
 *
 * Toggle policies are routed generically: the `policy.apply` command handler looks one
 * up by its [capabilityKey] in the registry and calls [setEnabled] — there is no
 * per-policy `when`/switch anywhere. Adding a new toggle is: implement this interface +
 * register its factory probe in [CapabilityRegistry.togglePolicies]. Nothing else changes.
