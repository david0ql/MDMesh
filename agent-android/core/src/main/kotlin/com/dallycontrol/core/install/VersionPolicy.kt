/**
 * Pure, Android-free version-gating logic for app installs.
 *
 * Ported from Headwind's `InstallUtils.generateApplicationsForInstallList` /
 * `compareVersions` rules, distilled to a single decision over version codes:
 *
 *  - A `null` or `0` requested version code means **"any"**: install only if the app
 *    is not already present; otherwise skip (we don't reinstall an arbitrary version).
 *  - Requested **greater than** installed -> [Decision.Install] (an upgrade).
 *  - Requested **equal to** installed -> [Decision.Skip] (already at the target), unless a version name was asked
 *    that differs from the installed one and was not tried yet: some apps ship new builds under the same code and
 *    only change the name, and Android accepts the same code again.
 *  - Requested **less than** installed -> [Decision.DowngradeBlocked]. PackageInstaller
 *    refuses downgrades, so retrying would loop on download+install forever; the caller
 *    must explicitly uninstall the higher version first.
 *
 * Kept as an `object` with no dependencies so it is trivially unit-testable on the JVM.
