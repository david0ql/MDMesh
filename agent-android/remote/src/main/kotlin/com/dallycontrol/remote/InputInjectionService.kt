/**
 * The ONE place in the whole agent that uses Accessibility.
 *
 * During a remote-control session of [RemoteControlSession.Mode.CONTROL], the
 * admin's taps/swipes are replayed on the device via
 * [AccessibilityService.dispatchGesture] (enabled by `canPerformGestures="true"`
 * in `res/xml/input_injection_service.xml`).
 *
 * Stub: gesture dispatch is not implemented yet (it pairs with the WebRTC input
 * channel — see README). The service deliberately observes nothing —
 * [onAccessibilityEvent] is a no-op — because it injects, it does not snoop.
 *
 * It is declared `android:enabled="false"` and is only enabled at runtime once a
 * control-mode session is authorised; it must be disabled again when the session
 * ends so the device never carries a latent always-on accessibility surface.
