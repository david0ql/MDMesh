/**
 * A live remote-control session between an administrator and this device.
 *
 * Two modes (see `proto/README.md` § capability tiers):
 *  - [Mode.VIEW]    — MediaProjection screen capture only (Tier 0, universal).
 *  - [Mode.CONTROL] — capture + AccessibilityService input injection (Tier 1).
 *
 * Capture (MediaProjection) and signaling/transport (WebRTC) are deferred — see
 * this module's README. The contract is defined now so `:core` can dispatch
 * `remote.startSession` / `remote.stopSession` commands against a stable surface.
