 * [type] values and reply with [CommandStatus.UNSUPPORTED] rather than crashing.
 *
 * [payload] is intentionally a raw [JsonObject]: each command type owns its own
 * payload shape (see `proto/registry.md`), decoded lazily by the handler for that
 * type. Keeping it untyped here is what lets the registry grow without touching
 * this class.
